✅ You’re displaying the dashboard sidebar to public users — confusing and inappropriate.

👤 There’s no actual authentication gating — it looks like you’re always “logged in.”

🧭 Navigation is too complex for a public visitor.

🖼️ There’s no sense of product or brand — logo, description, or value proposition gets lost.

🎨 Design hierarchy and spacing feel mismatched — no clear visual distinction between sections.

✅ UX/Design Fix Plan
🎯 Goal:
Make a clear separation between:

Public Homepage

Authenticated dashboard (only after login)

✅ 1. Create a Clean Public Homepage (/)
Should include:
🏠 Header with logo, dark mode toggle, Login, and Apply Now

✨ Hero section with platform summary

👇 Call-to-action buttons:

“Login as Landlord”

“Login as Resident”

“Apply to Join” (links to /apply)

🔒 No sidebar, no dashboard on this screen

Example Layout:
plaintext
Copy
Edit
-------------------------------------------------
[ Rent Control ]      [🌙] [Login] [Apply Now]
-------------------------------------------------

🏠 The Complete Rent Control Platform
Streamline property management for landlords and tenants.
✅ Rent collection, ✅ Maintenance, ✅ Marketplace, ✅ Branding.

[ Login as Landlord ] [ Login as Resident ]
-------------------------------------------------

✅ 2. Restrict Dashboard Components
Update routing logic so that:

🛑 Sidebar, Dashboard, and /dashboard/* are only shown after login

🧑‍💼 Use a simple isAuthenticated && role === 'landlord' check

⚠️ If not logged in, auto-redirect to /login

Pseudocode Example:
jsx
Copy
Edit
<Route path="/dashboard" element={
  isAuthenticated && role === 'landlord' ? <DashboardLayout /> : <Navigate to="/login" />
} />
✅ 3. Add a Proper Login Route
Separate login page (/login) with:

Tabs for Landlord / Resident

Email + password

Optional: SSO placeholder or magic link login

✅ 4. Use Layout Components
Split the app into two layouts:

<PublicLayout> → homepage, login, apply

<DashboardLayout> → sidebar + dashboard content

✅ 5. Suggested Folder Structure
bash
Copy
Edit
/src
  /layouts
    PublicLayout.jsx
    DashboardLayout.jsx
  /pages
    Home.jsx
    Login.jsx
    Apply.jsx
    Dashboard.jsx
  /components
    Sidebar.jsx
    Navbar.jsx
✅ 6. Bonus Suggestions
🌓 Add dark mode switch in header only, not sidebar

🧾 Include testimonials or feature highlights in homepage

🎯 Add animated scroll CTA: “See what you can do with Rent Control”
