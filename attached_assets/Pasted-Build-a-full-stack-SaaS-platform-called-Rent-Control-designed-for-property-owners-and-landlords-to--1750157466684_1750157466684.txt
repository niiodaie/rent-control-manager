Build a full-stack SaaS platform called Rent Control, designed for property owners and landlords to manage residents, documents, rent payments, and an internal community marketplace.

Use React + Tailwind CSS for the frontend and Express.js + MongoDB (or mock DB) for the backend. Frontend hosted on Replit, backend on Render. This is not a public listing service — it is a private, multi-tenant property management tool.
